# memory-pairs-game
The classic **Memory Game** with adorable animals. 🐘🐘🦜🦜 Match pairs, triplets and even quartets!

This game was made for my 5 & 3 y/o cousins, and they liked it! Also, this project helped me to improve my Vue.js skills. 

[Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/) is used in this project in order to enhance the UI and its contribution is noticeable.
